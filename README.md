# BasketballMVC
<h1> My first MVC Project </h1>
<p>
  This project demonstrates a functional grid with CRUD operations. A user can add and edit details of exisiting data entries on the grid specified to basketball exercises. When adding new entries, a user will be prompt to add details of user's name, exerscise name, date, start and end time which all go through a validation process.

<ul>
  <li>BasketballController</li>
  <li>/Basketball/Index</li>
  <li>/Scripts/PopupForm</li>
  <li>/Scripts/LoadDataTable</li>

</ul>
